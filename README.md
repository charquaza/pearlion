## Overview

Pearlion is a modern e-commerce platform built to showcase and sell jewelry products. The application supports dynamic product listings, user-generated ratings and reviews, authentication and role-based authorization, secure checkout and accurate tax calculations using Stripe, and a responsive, accessible design. Pearlion is optimized for performance and scalability, deployed using a multi-cloud approach.

Developed as a proof of concept for my wife, who has aspirations of selling her own handmade jewelry, Pearlion is adaptable to any business that needs a platform for showcasing products/services and securely handling transactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v14 or higher
- PostgreSQL database (local or AWS RDS)
- Stripe developer account

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/charquaza/pearlion.git
   cd pearlion
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   - **Backend:**
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm install
     ```

   - **Frontend:**
     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   - For the backend, create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following:

     ```env
     FRONTEND_DOMAIN=your_frontend_url

     DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
     DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
     DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
     DB_HOST=your_database_host
     DB_PORT=your_database_port
     DB_DIALECT=postgres

     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     JWT_EXPIRES_IN=your_jwt_time_until_expiration

     STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_api_key
     STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET=your_stripe_endpoint_secret
     ```

   `FRONTEND_DOMAIN` will be `localhost` in development.
   `STRIPE_API_KEY` can be obtained by creating a Stripe developer account ([learn more here](https://docs.stripe.com/keys)).
   `STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET` is used with webhooks ([learn more here](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)).

   - For the frontend, create a `.env` file in the `client-next` directory and add:

     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_backend_url
     NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_API_KEY=your_public_stripe_api_key
     ```

   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` will be `localhost` in development.
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_API_KEY` can be obtained by creating a Stripe developer account ([learn more here](https://docs.stripe.com/keys)).

4. **Run the development servers:**

   - **Backend:**
     ```bash
     cd ../server
     npm run devstart
     ```

   - **Frontend (in a new terminal):**
     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm run dev
     ```

   Both the frontend and backend will be available at `localhost`, with the ports being dependent on your specific configuration.
